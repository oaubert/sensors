Collection of various files used during a seminar dedicated to sensor data
==========================================================================

The most interesting file is wahzup.html, which was the file displayed
(and hacked live) during the seminar. It is built upon
graph_citizen.html. It cannot be used as is anymore, since it relies
on an access to the CitizenData platform.

The accelerometer collection pages cz.html (which sends data to the
CitizenData platform) and box.html (which sends data to the
stereolux's sensorbox) are derived from
https://github.com/Kanasansoft/Graph-of-Accelerometer.git

scenopulse is a proof of concept visualisation - see

Ongoing work
============

To remove the dependency on CitizenData, a standalone version is being
developped. Its server, server.py, serves the html files (collection
and visualisation) and is also the websocket server broadcasting
messages.

To use it, run it

  python server.py

and open http://localhost:9000/static/sensor.html
